# nativefier-microsoft-todo

Builder for a native app wrapper for Microsoft To-Do using [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier). 

Inspired by (https://github.com/Wowu/microsoft-todo-osx). However, those binaries haven't been updated in some 
time and the underlying Electron runtime does not automatically receive security updates.

To use it, install Nativifier with

```bash
npm install nativefier -g
```

Then execute build.sh to create a packaged binary.
